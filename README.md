`shcli-starterkit` is a CLI tools to make shell script cli tool for your
project.

## Install

### Clone Repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yassun7010/shcli-starterkit.git
```

### Install `cmdcomp`

#### Docker

If you are running dockerd, `cmdcomp` will automatically run using the Docker
image.

#### pipx

If `cmdcomp` is installed locally, it takes precedence over the Docker Image
method. You can use the following method to install `cmdcomp`.

```sh
pipx install cmdcomp
```

### Set up your shell environment for `shcli`

#### For `bash`

```sh:bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'"$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "[[ -x `which shcli` ]] && eval \"$(shcli init -)\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

#### For `zsh`

```sh:zsh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'"$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.zsh_profile
echo "[[ -x `which shcli` ]] && eval \"$(shcli init -)\"" >> ~/.zsh_profile
```

## Usage

Go to the repository where you want to install cli and execute the following
command. As a result, The `cli` and `bin` directories will be created.

```sh
YOUR_PROJECT=
cd $YOUR_PROJECT

PROJECT_NAME=
COMMAND_NAME=
install-shcli $PROJECT_NAME $COMMAND_NAME

# Please read the README for instructions on how to use the generated cli tool.
less cli/README.md
```

## For Developer

### Directory structure

The `template` directory has real sources. The `cli` and `bin` directories are
symbolic links to the directory of the same name in `template`.

The reason why we have symbolic links is that we want to use the `shcli` command
in development process. The symbolic link allows the `shcli` command to be fully
functional without having to look in the `template` directory.

```text

â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode -> template/cli/.vscode
â”œâ”€â”€ bin -> template/bin
â”œâ”€â”€ cli -> template/cli
â”œâ”€â”€ template
